👤 Challenge: Company Contacts
As a developer, I have been tasked with creating a Rails application to store account information for a company. I want to ensure that only valid data can be saved in the database.

All tasks should have accompanying model specs.

✔️ Acceptance Criteria
The application data should be managed by a PostgreSQL database in a Rails application.
The model should be called Account with username, password, and email attributes.
    - rails g model Account username:string password:string email:string
    
Every account should require entries for username, password, and email.
Every username should be at least five (5) characters long.
Every username should be unique.
Every password should be at least six (6) characters long.
Every password should be unique.
The Account model has an associated model called Addresses where an account can have many addresses.
The Address model should have a street_number, street_name, city, state, and zip attributes. The street_number and zip should be integers.
Every address should require entries for street_number, street_name, city, state, and zip.

Every account password should have at least one number.
